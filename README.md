# OOP-Project
To play this game you can compile all of the java files and run the Game.class file.

To do this first navigate to this directory in your terminal.
Then type "javac *.java"
then type "java Game"
You should be prompted with the start of the game.

You can also make your own stories by creating a csv file.
Right now you will always play the default story that we have created.
